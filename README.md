## Python

1. Replit provides an 'integrated development environment' or 'IDE' for coding.

2. An IDE provides a few things you need to 'run' code, of whatever type --- Python, Java, C ... whatever.

3. For the high school class, eventually we'll move a large part of our work down to the machine and, with a few things, replicate what is accomplished in Replit's online, browser-based IDE.

4. You need only a few things on your computer in order to 'code' or program in any given language:

- a text editor

- a terminal / console

- a 'run-time' environment

5. For now we'll use those three ingredients on Replit.com.
